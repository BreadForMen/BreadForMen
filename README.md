### - ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an all-in-one, gluten-free, farm-raised, non-GMO loaf of bread.
### - ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create said loaf.
### - ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on others who would like to create an all-in-one, gluten-free, farm-raised, non-GMO loaf of bread.
### - ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my adventure because I am simply bread... for men.
### - ğŸ’¬ Ask me about your favourite type of bread. White, whole-wheat, whole-grain, anything you can think of.
### - ğŸ“« How to reach me: breadformen@gmail.com
### - ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: toast, loaf, breaddy, honestly, just call me whatever. I don't care.
